=== How to use FixtureReplacement

Full Documentation is coming, when time permits.  For now, watch this screencast (and forward
through my stupidity):

http://railsnewbie.com/files/fixture_replacement_demo.mov

There is also some documentation at the following link, although the screencast is still advised:

http://wincent.com/knowledge-base/FixtureReplacement_cheatsheet


=== Installation

  ruby script/plugin install http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement/
  
Or use externals:

  ruby script/plugin install -x http://thmadb.com/public_svn/plugins/fixture_replacement/
  
Run the generator if you don't have the file db/example_data.rb

  ruby script/generate fixture_replacement


=== Running the Specs/Tests for FixtureReplacement

You will need rspec (version 1.0.8 or later) to run the specs, as well as the sqlite3-ruby gem 
(and sqlite3 installed):

  % sudo gem install rspec
  % sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

cd into the fixture_replacement plugin directory:
  
  % cd vendor/plugins/fixture_replacement
  
Then run with rake

  % rake
